# 🎲 Guess the Number Game (React Native)

Guess the Number is a fun React Native mobile game with a twist:
Instead of the player guessing the number, the phone guesses the number chosen by the player!
The player guides the phone by adjusting the range after each guess until the phone finds the correct answer.
